- pnpm 10.19.0 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Development Setup

cd Pricey
```

2. **Install dependencies**

pnpm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables**

cp .env.example .env
```

4. **Start infrastructure services**

```bash
pnpm docker:dev
```

5. **Run database migrations**

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

6. **Start development servers**

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions/updates

Example: `feature/receipt-upload`, `fix/ocr-parsing`

### Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions/updates
- `chore:` - Build process or auxiliary tool changes

Example:

```
feat(api): add receipt upload endpoint
fix(ocr): improve text extraction accuracy
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use strict mode, avoid `any`
- **Formatting**: We use Prettier - run `pnpm format` before committing
- **Linting**: We use ESLint - run `pnpm lint` before committing
- **Type Safety**: Run `pnpm typecheck` to verify TypeScript types

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Building

```bash
# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Build specific package
pnpm --filter @pricy/api-gateway build
```
