# License Header Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Automated License Header Tool

**File**: `scripts/add-license-headers.js`

A Node.js script that automatically adds AGPL3 license headers to all source code files in the project. The script:

- Scans all TypeScript, JavaScript, and CSS files
- Detects if a file already has a license header
- Adds the appropriate header format based on file type (JSDoc for JS/TS, CSS comment for CSS files)
- Can be run repeatedly without duplicating headers

### 2. Added NPM Script

**File**: `package.json`

Added a new npm script for easy execution:

```json
"add-license": "node scripts/add-license-headers.js"
```

Usage:

```bash
npm run add-license
```

### 3. Applied Headers to All Source Files

Successfully added AGPL3 license headers to 25+ source files including:

- All TypeScript files in `src/` directory
  - `src/types/index.ts`
  - `src/lib/*.ts`
  - `src/app/**/*.tsx`
  - `src/components/**/*.tsx`
- All JavaScript files
  - `scripts/check-env.js`
- Configuration files
  - `eslint.config.mjs`
  - `next.config.mjs`
  - `postcss.config.mjs`
  - `tailwind.config.ts`
- All CSS files
  - `src/app/globals.css`

### 4. Created Documentation

**File**: `docs/LICENSE_HEADERS.md`

Comprehensive documentation covering:

- Required header format for different file types
- Instructions for using the automated tool
- Guidelines for when to add headers
- Which files should/shouldn't have headers
- Rationale for using AGPL3

### 5. Updated README

**File**: `README.md`

Added a new section under "Contributing" that:

- Emphasizes the mandatory nature of license headers
- Provides instructions for the automated tool
- Links to detailed documentation
- Updates license section with more details

## License Header Format

```

### For CSS Files

```css

```

## Benefits

1. **Legal Compliance**: Ensures all source files properly indicate copyright and license
2. **Automation**: No manual copy-pasting required
3. **Consistency**: All headers follow the same format
4. **Idempotent**: Can run the tool multiple times safely
5. **Documentation**: Clear guidelines for contributors

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:

- Pre-commit hook to automatically check for license headers
- CI/CD check to validate all files have headers
- Support for additional file types if needed
- Template for creating new files with headers included

## Verification

To verify all files have proper headers, you can:

1. Run the tool again (it will skip files that already have headers):

   ```bash
   npm run add-license
   ```

2. Manually check key files:

   ```bash
   head -n 20 src/app/page.tsx
   head -n 20 src/lib/utils.ts
   ```

3. Search for files without headers:
   ```bash
   # Find TypeScript files without the header
   grep -L "GNU Affero General Public License" src/**/*.ts src/**/*.tsx
   ```

## Dependencies Added

- `glob` (npm package) - For file pattern matching and scanning

## Files Modified

1. `scripts/add-license-headers.js` (new)
2. `docs/LICENSE_HEADERS.md` (new)
3. `package.json` (added script)
4. `README.md` (updated Contributing and License sections)
5. 25+ source code files (added license headers)
