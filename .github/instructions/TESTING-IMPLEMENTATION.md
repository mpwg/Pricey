| **Overall**         | **75%**          | **85%** |

### 4. Testing Patterns Documented

- ✅ Pure function testing
- ✅ Mocking with Vitest
- ✅ Zod schema validation testing
- ✅ Fastify API route testing
- ✅ OCR parser testing
- ✅ Error handling testing
- ✅ Edge case testing

### 5. Example Tests

Created example test file:

- `apps/api-gateway/src/utils/file-validation.test.ts`
- Demonstrates comprehensive testing patterns
- Tests happy path, edge cases, and error cases
- 100+ lines of test examples

### 6. CI/CD Integration

- GitHub Actions workflow template provided
- Pre-commit hooks configuration
- Coverage reporting to Codecov
- Automated test runs on PR and push

### 7. Updated Copilot Instructions

Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to reference the new testing mandate:

- Tests are now MANDATORY for all new code
- Links to comprehensive testing documentation
- Clear coverage targets

## Commands Available

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Coverage report
pnpm test:coverage

# Visual UI
pnpm test:ui

# Specific package
pnpm --filter @pricey/api-gateway test
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Install all new dependencies
pnpm install
```

### 2. Write Tests for Existing Code

Priority order:

1. ✅ **Critical Path** (Week 1):
   - OCR parsers (date, item, total, store)
   - Zod validation schemas
   - Fastify routes
   - Storage service

2. ✅ **Core Utilities** (Week 2):
   - File validation
   - Date utilities
   - Text processing helpers

3. ✅ **Services** (Week 3):
   - Queue service
   - Receipt processor
   - OCR worker

### 3. Set Up CI/CD

```bash
# Create GitHub Actions workflow
cp .github/instructions/testing-mandate.instructions.md \
   .github/workflows/test.yml
# (extract the workflow section)
```

### 4. Enable Pre-commit Hooks

```bash
# Install Husky
pnpm add -Dw husky lint-staged

# Initialize hooks
pnpm prepare
```

## Testing Philosophy

> **"Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration."** - Kent C. Dodds

### Focus Areas

1. **Behavior over Implementation**: Test what the code does, not how
2. **Fast Feedback**: Unit tests < 1s, full suite < 5min
3. **Living Documentation**: Tests document expected behavior
4. **Confidence to Refactor**: Safe to improve code with tests

## Enforcement

### Mandatory for New Code

All new code MUST include:

- ✅ Unit tests for all functions
- ✅ Edge case tests
- ✅ Error handling tests
- ✅ Minimum 75% coverage
- ✅ Tests pass in CI/CD

### Code Review Checklist

Reviewers must verify:

- [ ] All new functions have tests
- [ ] Edge cases are tested
- [ ] Error cases are tested
- [ ] Coverage meets threshold
- [ ] Tests are fast and isolated
- [ ] CI/CD passes

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module 'vitest'"

**Solution**: Run `pnpm install`

### Issue: Tests timing out

**Solution**: Increase timeout in vitest.config.ts:

```typescript
test: {
  testTimeout: 10000,
}
```

### Issue: Coverage not showing

**Solution**: Run `pnpm test:coverage` and check `coverage/` directory

## Conclusion

✅ **Comprehensive testing infrastructure is now in place**

All developers must:

1. Read the testing mandate document
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Start writing tests for all new code
4. Review existing code and add tests

**No new PRs should be merged without tests.**
