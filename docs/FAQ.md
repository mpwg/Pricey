## Troubleshooting

### Why is my receipt processing stuck?

Common reasons:

1. **Large image size**: Images >10MB are rejected
2. **Invalid format**: Only JPEG, PNG, WEBP supported
3. **Server overload**: Wait a few minutes and try again
4. **LLM provider issue**: Check system status

Try refreshing the page or re-uploading.

### The OCR results are incorrect. What can I do?

**Phase 0**: Unfortunately, manual correction is not yet available.

**Phase 1+**: You'll be able to manually edit all extracted fields.

Tips for better results:

- Use high-resolution images
- Ensure good lighting and no blur
- Flatten the receipt (no creases)
- Crop to show only the receipt

### Can I delete my receipts?

**Phase 0**: Not yet. Contact us at [support@mpwg.eu](mailto:support@mpwg.eu).

**Phase 1+**: You'll be able to delete receipts from your account dashboard.

### The app is not loading. What should I do?

1. Check your internet connection
2. Try refreshing the page (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Try a different browser
5. Check GitHub Issues for known problems

If the problem persists, [report an issue](https://github.com/mpwg/Pricey/issues).
